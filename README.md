# Task
Create a new branch named after your real name.
Please download the source code and install the backend.
You need to install MongoDB to make it work.
The backend api is served using the following endpoints:
GET: http://localhost:3000/todos
GET: http://localhost:3000/todos/:id
POST: http://localhost:3000/todos
PUT: http://localhost:3000/:id
DELETE: http://localhost:3000/:id

Please create a todo app using React/Redux, Thunk.
There should an input box and a button named "add" at the top for adding todos.
Below the input box, it should display the list of todos.
For each todo, it should show an input box, buttons named "update" & "delete" for updating & deleting todos.
When the app runs the first time, it should fetch all the todos from the back-end api.

Please use your real name when you make commits.
After the task is finished, please send a PR to the master branch.
